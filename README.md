# Palindrome-checker
Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://palindrome-checker.freecodecamp.rocks, A Palindrome checker project from JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum




## Overview
This project is a simple web application that checks whether a given input string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## Features
- Input element with an id of `text-input`.
- Button element with an id of `check-btn` to initiate the palindrome check.
- Div element with an id of `result` to display the result of the palindrome check.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to be able to input a string.
2. As a user, I want to be able to click a button to check if the input string is a palindrome.
3. As a user, I want to see the result of the palindrome check displayed on the screen.


For detailed user stories, please refer to the [UserStories.md](USERSTORIES.md)

## Usage
1. Enter a string into the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button.
3. The result of the palindrome check will be displayed below the input field.
